# Legendary Programmer Hall of Fame üèÜ

A community-curated list of legendary programmers. This repository serves as the data source for [https://www.trevorlasn.com/hall-of-fame](https://www.trevorlasn.com/hall-of-fame), celebrating the visionaries who laid the foundation for modern computing.

## About

Every line of code we write today stands on the shoulders of giants. From the early pioneers who dreamed up the first algorithms to modern innovators pushing the boundaries of what's possible, this Hall of Fame celebrates the legendary programmers who shaped our digital world.

As developers, we use tools, languages, and concepts created by these visionaries every day. Understanding their contributions helps us appreciate the evolution of computer science and gives context to the technologies we work with. From Ada Lovelace's first algorithm to modern innovations in AI and distributed systems, each hall of fame member represents a crucial step in computing history.

## Data Structure

Each programmer entry follows this structure:

```typescript
{
  id: string;          // kebab-case unique identifier
  name: string;        // Full name and optional nickname
  description: string; // Brief bio focusing on technical contributions
  year: string;        // Birth-Death or "Birth-present"
  mainContribution: string; // Primary technical contribution
}
```

## How to Nominate

We welcome nominations for programming pioneers who have made significant technical contributions to the field. Follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your nomination to `programmers.json`
3. Submit a Pull Request with the following information:
   - Brief explanation of why this person should be included
   - Links to supporting information about their contributions
   - Ensure the entry follows the data structure format

### Nomination Guidelines

A good nomination should be for someone who:
