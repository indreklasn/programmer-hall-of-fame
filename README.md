# Programmer Hall of Fame üèÜ

A community-curated list of programming pioneers who shaped the software industry. This repository serves as the data source for [https://www.trevorlasn.com/hall-of-fame](https://www.trevorlasn.com/hall-of-fame), celebrating the visionaries who laid the foundation for modern computing.

## About

These pioneers didn't just write code - they dreamed up entirely new ways of thinking. From Ada's first algorithm to today's innovations, each pioneer pushed the boundaries of what's possible. Their ideas live on in every line of code we write.

## Data Structure

Each programmer entry follows this structure:

```typescript
interface Programmer {
  id: string;          // kebab-case unique identifier
  name: string;        // Full name and optional nickname
  description: string; // Brief bio focusing on technical contributions
  year: string;        // Birth-Death or "Birth-present"
  mainContribution: string; // Primary technical contribution
}
```
